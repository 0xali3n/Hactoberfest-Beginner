## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:

- Prepare and share your project for collaboration
- Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
- Organize an event
- Mentor others
- Donate directly to open source projects


## How Does it Work?
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
- Maintainers determine if their open-source projects participate.
- Quality pull requests submitted on GitHub and GitLab are rewarded.
- Engaged maintenance of Hacktoberfest tagged repositories are rewarded.


This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.
